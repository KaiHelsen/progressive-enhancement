<h2>The story</h2>

    <blockquote>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to
        commiserate. They said, "We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate." The
        farmer
        said, "<em>Maybe</em>." The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
        evening
        everybody
        came back and said, "Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!" The
        farmer again
        said, "<em>Maybe</em>."</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The
        neighbors then said, "Oh dear, that’s too bad," and the farmer responded, "<em>Maybe</em>." The next
        day the
        conscription
        officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
        Again
        all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, </q><em>Maybe</em>.</q></blockquote>

    <blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <p><cite>Alan Watts</cite></p></blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
